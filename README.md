# weatherApp

Simple web application built using React and a weather API. 
Wanted some practice with different JS frameworks, and I hadn't built anything in React previously. Components are always convenient, and the framework has both a helpful and plentiful community. 


**Required languages**: HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS

# What I Learned

* The possible complexity of seemingly small projects. 
* Making successful API calls.
